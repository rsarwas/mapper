#### ![ ](../mapper-images/templates.png) Template setup window
**Ctrl+Shift+9**

Switches the display of the [template setup window](templates.md#setup) on the map screen. This provides access to the functions required to open, scale, and position a template, and to close it.


#### Open template...

Opens a template file directly without going through the setup window.


#### Reopen template...

Shows the template reopen dialog where templates which have been opened and then closed before can be restored.
